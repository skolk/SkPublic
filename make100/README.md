#Make100
'Make 100 is in the spirt  of quantity over quality results in quality, so now that I'm 30, and it's been 5 years since my last project 'make Daily' where I made 30 objects in 30 days, I'm revisiting what I create, produce, and revisiting my outputs.

I'm choosing to use git as both the journal and as the code better to better track my progress.
